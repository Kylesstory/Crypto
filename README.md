# Crypto
A crypto library that contains several operations about encryption and computation over cipher-texts, which mostly fouses on public key encryption schemes.

This is written by Python 3.7.2; and it is still a beta version.

The operation is easy, just enter

***python3 main.py***

So far, just a smart part finished. The supported algorithms are listed below:

***Encryption***: RSA, ElGamal, Paillier

***Signature***: None
